# Arrays and Strings practise in Java
Implement HashMap, ArrayList, StringBuilder from scratch for practising.

## Main.java
run tests.

## HM01.java
HashMap.  
It needs `LinkedList.java` and `Node.java`.

### ToDo
Implement a feature to delete element.

## AL01.java
ArrayList.  

### ToDo
Now it can take String type only, it needs to change to generics.

## SB01.java
StringBuilder.

### ToDo
`toString()` method's complexity can be reduced.
